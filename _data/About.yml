  - title: Introduction
    description: Hello! Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I am a passionate, multi-disciplinary Information Technology domain worker with experience in many frameworks, languages, technologies and infrastructure. I feel my most valuable traits are my critical thinking and analysis skills, my business value mindset and my soft skills. I can very quickly pick up on any tech stack or methodology being employed by a project, and love finding new ways to drive business success. I find work to be most rewarding when it is new, experimental, fast-paced and makes the end user happy. In my free time I like to keep up with AI and ML developments, lift weights, run, and study theology. Feel free to connect with me via email at <westondavidson@outlook.com> or through text/call at [1 (386) 341-5726](tel:13863415726). I look forward to hearing from you!
